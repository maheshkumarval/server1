sometimes "***k the Millennium", 
is a protest song by 
2K—Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty. 
The duo are better known as 
the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu 
(the JAMs) or the KLF. The 
song was built around the KLF and Acid Brass's 
versions of "What Time Is Love?", and 
premiered at 2K's "1997" event, held 
at London's Barbican Centre on 17 September 
1997 and directed by Ken 
Campbell. 2K's lifespan was billed as the 
duration of the live event's performance—23 
minutes. The song was released as a 
comeback single to mark the tenth 
anniversary of Drummond and Cauty's first 
collaborations; however, the performance 
and single were also 
in part intended to mock the notion of the comeback. The 
song reached number 28 in the UK Singles Chart 
in October 1997.
